# Network Analysis using Graphs
  The project, titled "Network Analysis using Graphs," is a data structures project for the Spring 2021 semester at the FAST School of Computing, Islamabad Campus. It involved analyzing three datasets: General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology collaboration network, Astro Physics collaboration network, and Amazon product co-purchasing network. I have implemented tasks including calculating graph statistics (number of nodes, edges, source/sink/isolated nodes, bridge edges, articulation nodes, shortest path length distribution, and diameter), degree distributions (in-degree and out-degree), and connected components (largest strongly connected component, size distribution of all SCCs, largest weakly connected component, size distribution of all WCCs). I used algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) for shortest path length distribution, Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm, and Weakly Connected Components (WCC) algorithm for connected components analysis.
